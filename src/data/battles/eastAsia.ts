    description: "The Siege of Suiyang was one of the most harrowing defensive stands in military history, fought during the devastating An Lushan Rebellion against the Tang Dynasty. General Zhang Xun and a small garrison held the city for ten months against over 100,000 rebel troops, enduring starvation so extreme it became legendary. Though Suiyang eventually fell and Zhang Xun was executed, the prolonged defense prevented the rebels from advancing into southern China and bought crucial time for the Tang to regroup and ultimately suppress the rebellion."
