    description: "Ashurbanipal of Assyria sent his army against the Elamite kingdom, and the two forces clashed at the Ulai River in a catastrophically one-sided battle. The Elamite king Teumman was killed and beheaded during the rout. Ashurbanipal's palace reliefs at Nineveh graphically depict the river choked with Elamite corpses and the king's severed head being carried in triumph. In one famous relief panel, Ashurbanipal and his queen dine in a garden with Teumman's head hanging from a nearby tree. The battle broke Elamite power and is one of the most vividly documented battles of the ancient world."

    description: "After years of Babylonian revolts, Sennacherib of Assyria lost patience and ordered the complete destruction of Babylon, one of the most ancient and revered cities in Mesopotamia. His army razed the city's walls, temples, and palaces, then diverted canals to flood the ruins. The destruction of Babylon, especially its sacred temples, shocked the ancient world and was considered an act of supreme sacrilege. Many Assyrians believed that the subsequent murder of Sennacherib by his own sons was divine punishment for destroying the holy city. His successor Esarhaddon would later rebuild Babylon to atone for the crime."

    description: "Sennacherib of Assyria faced a massive coalition of Babylonians, Elamites, Chaldeans, and Aramaean tribes at Halule on the Tigris River. It was one of the largest battles in Mesopotamian history. Sennacherib's inscriptions claim a great victory with rivers of enemy blood, but the fact that Babylon remained independent after the battle suggests the outcome was less decisive than claimed. The inconclusive result frustrated Sennacherib so deeply that two years later he would take the drastic step of completely destroying Babylon."

The conquest of Memphis brought Egypt under Assyrian control for the first time, uniting the two oldest civilizations of the Near East under one empire. Esarhaddon erected a victory stele showing Taharqa's son in chains. However, Assyrian control over Egypt proved difficult to maintain, and Taharqa would later recapture Memphis, forcing Esarhaddon's successor Ashurbanipal to invade Egypt again."

The destruction of Ur ended Sumerian political power forever, though Sumerian culture and language survived as a scholarly tradition. The fall inspired the 'Lament for Ur,' one of the oldest and most moving works of literature, describing the goddess Ningal weeping over her destroyed city."
